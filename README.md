# Minesweeper


This was an attempt to create the classic computer game, Minesweeper. I used the C Programming Language to create this game!

The board has a 10 x 10 grid of 12 mines randomly placed in the area. There are 88 remaining spaces for the player to select. Once the player selects all 88 spaces, they will have won the game. If they click on any of the 12 mines before that, they will have lost.
